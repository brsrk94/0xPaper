Writing in public begins with experimenting on the page itself. This site is a little operating system for ideas: each layout block is hand-tuned, the Markdown is honest, and the UI leans on a minimalist palette so the machinery fades into the background. That setup makes it easy to drop in a new paragraph, embed, or command and immediately see the effect.

<div class="feature-card">
  <p class="feature-title">Video</p>
  <p class="feature-lead">A paragraph about how this page handles video: text frames the purpose, then the embed follows so the viewer sees the clip in context.</p>
  <p>Below is an embedded Rick Astley clip (yes, the classic). The iframe is centered, sized for the column, and padded so the controls never overlap the surrounding copy.</p>
  <div class="feature-video">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ" title="Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
