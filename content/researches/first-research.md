This research explores
<span class="curl-blue">clean energy prediction</span>
using
<span class="curl-green">Support Vector Machines (SVM)</span>
with a focus on robust forecasting under changing and noisy real-world conditions. The work emphasizes strong feature design, model tuning, and reliable evaluation so that
<span class="curl-orange">prediction quality</span>
remains stable across different demand and supply patterns.

The core objective is to improve
<span class="curl-blue">forecast consistency</span>
and reduce
<span class="curl-green">prediction error</span>
for clean energy planning workflows. The analysis compares model behavior under varied data splits and parameter settings to validate
<span class="curl-orange">deployment readiness</span>.
